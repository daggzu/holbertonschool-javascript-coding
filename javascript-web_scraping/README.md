# JavaScript - Web Scraping Learning!




# General Questions:




## Why JavaScript programming is amazing?
JavaScript is amazing for several reasons:

1. **Versatility**: JavaScript can be used for both front-end and back-end development. It's the language of the web, but it's also
used in many other contexts, such as server-side programming with Node.js, mobile app development with React Native, and even desktop
applications with Electron.

2. **Community and Ecosystem**: JavaScript has one of the largest developer communities and a vast ecosystem of libraries and
frameworks, which means you can find a package or tool for almost anything you need.

3. **Asynchronous Programming**: JavaScript's event-driven nature makes it excellent for handling asynchronous operations, which is
crucial for performance in web development.

4. **Browser Support**: Every modern web browser has a built-in JavaScript engine, which makes it the most accessible programming
language for web development.

5. **Continuous Improvement**: The language is continuously evolving and improving, with new features being added regularly to keep it
modern and powerful.




## How to manipulate JSON data?
Manipulating JSON data in JavaScript involves several steps:

1. **Parsing JSON**: If you have a JSON string, you can convert it into a JavaScript object using `JSON.parse()`.

```javascript
let jsonString = '{"name":"John", "age":30, "city":"New York"}';
let jsonObject = JSON.parse(jsonString);
```

2. **Accessing Data**: You can access data in the JSON object just like any other JavaScript object.

```javascript
console.log(jsonObject.name); // Outputs: John
```

3. **Modifying Data**: You can modify the data in the JSON object like any other JavaScript object.

```javascript
jsonObject.name = "Jane";
console.log(jsonObject.name); // Outputs: Jane
```

4. **Adding Data**: You can add new data to the JSON object.

```javascript
jsonObject.gender = "Female";
console.log(jsonObject.gender); // Outputs: Female
```

5. **Deleting Data**: You can delete data from the JSON object using the `delete` keyword.

```javascript
delete jsonObject.age;
console.log(jsonObject.age); // Outputs: undefined
```

6. **Stringifying JSON**: If you want to convert your JavaScript object back into a JSON string, you can use `JSON.stringify()`.

```javascript
let jsonString = JSON.stringify(jsonObject);
console.log(jsonString); // Outputs: {"name":"Jane","city":"New York","gender":"Female"}
```




## How to use request and fetch API?
In JavaScript, you can use the `fetch` API to make HTTP requests. Here's a basic example of how to use it:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
  method: 'GET', // or 'POST'
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    // 'Authorization': 'Bearer your-token' (if needed)
  },
  // body: JSON.stringify(data), // data can be `string` or {object}!
})
.then(response => response.json()) // or .text() for text response
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch((error) => {
  console.error('Error:', error);
});
```

The `fetch` function returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object representing the response to the request. The response
object does not contain the actual data yet. To extract the JSON data from the response, we use the `.json()` method, which also
returns a Promise, because the reading of the body could be asynchronous.

If you're working in a Node.js environment, `fetch` is not available by default, but you can use the `node-fetch` package or other
libraries like `axios` or the built-in `http`/`https` modules. Here's an example using the `request` library, which is now deprecated
but still in use in many projects:

```javascript
const request = require('request');

request('https://api.example.com/data', function (error, response, body) {
  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {
    console.log(body) // Print the response
  }
})
```




## How to read and write a file usaing fs module?
In Node.js, you can use the `fs` (File System) module to read and write files. Here's how you can do it:

**Reading a file:**

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error:', err);
    return;
  }
  console.log(data);
});
```

In this example, `example.txt` is the name of the file you want to read. The `utf8` argument specifies the file encoding.

**Writing to a file:**

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

let data = 'Hello, World!';

fs.writeFile('example.txt', data, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error:', err);
    return;
  }
  console.log('File has been written');
});
```

In this example, `example.txt` is the name of the file you want to write to, and `data` is the content you want to write.

Remember, these operations are asynchronous. If you want to perform synchronous operations, you can use `fs.readFileSync` and `fs.
writeFileSync` instead, but be aware that these will block the rest of your code from executing until the file operation is complete.
